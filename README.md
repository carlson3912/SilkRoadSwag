Silk Road Swag DAO Whitepaper

Summary
The critical feature of digital currencies is that they are decentralized. This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank, but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks, and nodes. This decentralization allows these currencies and networks to attain levels of privacy and security previously unavailable. But can this concept of decentralization apply to businesses as well? Can we build a business that not only takes advantage of the blockchain to facilitate transactions, but also uses it to control company ownership, investments and even product design/manufacturing? Silk Road Swag (SRS), a trailblazer in the industry, is a clothing designer and manufacturer built on top of the Polygon blockchain. Internet users from anywhere in the world will be able to join the community by acquiring SILK token, giving them partial ownership of SRS and allowing them to make business decisions for the organization. 
Business Structure
Marketing/Sales: Anyone in the world with an internet connection can sell SRS products by building a website that interacts with our smart contracts. And since they spent effort creating the sale, their wallet automatically receives 10% of the profits generated through their gateway.
Designer: Anyone in the world with an internet connection can design clothes for SRS by submitting their proposal into the weekly competition. If their design is appreciated and receives enough votes, it will move to production and the artist will receive their share of the profits (See product description for more on weekly competition).
Manufacturer: Is there a system that can remove the need for approval?
Product description
Despite the revolutionary business structure, SRS’’s first product will be typical of the industry and familiar to all it’s customers: a limited collection of clothing items refreshed and displayed on the website every week. Every Monday, a new design competition will be initiated on the DAO website encouraging anyone from around the world to include their product in the vote. Once designs are uploaded, SILK token holders will be able to log on and vote for the products that they appreciate and believe will do well for the DAO. The crucial concept is that the voters all have a stake in the company, directly incentivizing them to make profitable decisions for the organization. Artist royalty, costs, piece count and sales price will all be submitted by the product designer and displayed next to the image of the product during the vote. See below for visual reference.

Once the weekly vote closes at 5 P.M PST on Friday, the top three ideas with the most votes will be automatically uploaded to the DAO shop and available for anyone to buy. All rights and ownership of the designs in the shop will go to the DAO. Silk Road Swag is poised to be the most revolutionary change to the clothing industry as the world transitions from Web 2.0 to 3.0. SRS will completely change what it means to be a designer, consumer and even business owner inside the industry.

Company description
Many of the company's strengths stem from the natural benefits of a DAO, which coincide nicely with societal and technological trends. With the unstoppable emergence of Web 3.0, internet users and networks are being introduced to levels of decentralization, privacy, security and accessibility never seen before. Ownership and control of the organization is equally available to all internet users around the world, advancing the cause of equality and expanding opportunity to all. The Internet, and society as a whole, is powerfully, and continually, striving towards expanding equality of opportunity; any organization that effectively builds upon this is bound to succeed. Additionally, SRS uniquely extends the idea of a DAO by giving ownership, and hence control of the company, to its own customers through order token payback. This unique trend will provide the organization with unique perspectives into the clothing market, and a competitive advantage over traditional clothing brands. Lastly, SRS looks to be driven by the passion of it’s community. Allowing token holders to submit business proposals for a vote, SRS’s motivated community will help find innovative solutions to any area of the organization.
Tokenomics
SILK token 
SILK token, (ERC-20), will debut with an ICO price at $10 dollars per, with a total of 10,000 tokens. Once all 10,000 tokens have been bought, new SILK will only be given to customers as a small percentage of their order cost. SRS’s founder, Jack, will be given additional tokens worth 15% of the total number of SILK minted. SILK will allow it’s holder to vote for designs and on business proposals created by other holders.

Future Improvements
SRS’s inventory will originally be solely manufactured and delivered by Visten Shop. If any group wants to provide one or both of these roles, they can apply to a verified partner. Trusted members of the communities will adjudicate verifications. Once a verified partner, the group can be elected to provide the service. Compensation for manufacturing and delivering is also included in the vote.


Problems solved/strength
Gives everyone equal access to ownership of the business and business decisions.
Decentralized so stakeholders don't need to trust the CEO and other leaders to make the right decisions.
Company is owned by the customers, who knows what’s going to sell best other than the customers?
